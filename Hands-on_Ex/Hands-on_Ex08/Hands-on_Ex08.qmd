# 1. Overview

In this hands-on exercise for Week 8 lesson, I will gain hands-on experience on how to delineate homogeneous region by using geographically referenced multivariate data. There are two major analysis, namely:

-   hierarchical cluster analysis; and

-   spatially constrained cluster analysis(Hands on exercise for Week 9).

**Note:** For this hands-on exercise 08, it will only cover **hierarchical cluster analysis**. The second part will be in hands-on exercise 09 for week 9 lesson.

## 1.1 Learning Outcome

By the end of two hands-on exercise (Week 8 & Week9), I will able:

-   to convert GIS polygon data into R’s simple feature data.frame by using appropriate functions of **sf**package of R;

-   to convert simple feature data.frame into R’s SpatialPolygonDataFrame object by using appropriate **sf** of package of R;

-   to perform custer analysis by using *hclust()* of Base R;

-   to perform spatially constrained cluster analysis using *skater()* of Base R; and

-   to visualise the analysis output by using **ggplot2** and **tmap** package.

# 2. Getting Started

## 2.1 The Analytical Question

In geobusiness and spatial policy, it is a common practice to delineate the market or planning area into homogeneous regions by using multivariate data. In this hands-on exercise, we are interested to delineate [Shan State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_State), [Myanmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar) into homogeneous regions by using multiple Information and Communication technology (ICT) measures, namely: Radio, Television, Land line phone, Mobile phone, Computer, and Internet at home.

# 3. The Data

Two data sets will be used in this study. They are:

-   Myanmar Township Boundary Data (i.e. *myanmar_township_boundaries*) : This is a GIS data in ESRI shapefile format. It consists of township boundary information of Myanmar. The spatial data are captured in polygon features.

-   *Shan-ICT.csv*: This is an extract of [**The 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census Myanmar**](https://myanmar.unfpa.org/en/publications/2014-population-and-housing-census-myanmar-data-sheet) at the township level.

Both data sets are download from [Myanmar Information Management Unit (MIMU)](http://themimu.info/)

## 3.1 Installing and Loading R Packages

Before we get started, it is important for us to install the necessary R packages into R and launch these R packages into R environment.

The R packages needed for this exercise are as follows:

-   Spatial data handling

    -   **sf**, **rgdal** and **spdep**

-   Attribute data handling

    -   **tidyverse**, especially **readr**, **ggplot2** and **dplyr**

-   Choropleth mapping

    -   **tmap**

-   Multivariate data visualisation and analysis

    -   **coorplot**, **ggpubr**, and **heatmaply**

-   Cluster analysis

    -   **cluster**

    -   **ClustGeo**

The code chunks below installs and launches these R packages into R environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(spdep, tmap, sf, ClustGeo, 
               ggpubr, cluster, factoextra, NbClust,
               heatmaply, corrplot, psych, tidyverse, GGally)
```

::: callout-note
Note: With **tidyverse**, we do not have to install **readr**, **ggplot2** and **dplyr** packages separately. In fact, **tidyverse** also installs other very useful R packages such as **tidyr**.
:::

# 4. Data Import and Preparation

## 4.1 Importing Geospatial Data into R Environmnet

In this section, I will import Myanmar Township Boundary GIS data and its associated attrbiute table into R environment.

The Myanmar Township Boundary GIS data is in ESRI shapefile format. It will be imported into R environment by using the [*st_read()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sf/versions/0.7-2/topics/st_read) function of **sf**.

The code chunks used are shown below:

```{r}
shan_sf <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", 
                   layer = "myanmar_township_boundaries") %>%
  filter(ST %in% c("Shan (East)", "Shan (North)", "Shan (South)")) %>%
  select(c(2:7))
```

The imported township boundary object is called *shan_sf*. It is saved in **simple feature data.frame**format. We can view the content of the newly created *shan_sf* simple features data.frame by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
shan_sf
```

Notice that sf.data.frame is conformed to Hardy Wickham’s [tidy](https://edzer.github.io/rstudio_conf/#1) framework.

Since *shan_sf* is conformed to tidy framework, we can also *glimpse()* to reveal the data type of it’s fields.

```{r}
glimpse(shan_sf)
```

## 4.2 Importing Aspatial Data into R Environment

The csv file will be import using *read_csv* function of **readr** package.

The code chunks used are shown below:

```{r}
ict <- read_csv ("data/aspatial/Shan-ICT.csv")
```

The imported InfoComm variables are extracted from **The 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census Myanmar**. The attribute data set is called *ict*. It is saved in R’s \* tibble data.frame\* format.

The code chunk below reveal the summary statistics of *ict* data.frame.

```{r}
summary(ict)
```

There are a total of 11 fields and 55 observation in the tibble data.frame.

## 4.3 Derive New Variable using dplyr Package

The unit of measurement of the values are number of household. Using these values directly will be bias by the underlying total number of households. In general, the townships with relatively higher total number of households will also have higher number of households owning radio, TV, etc.

In order to overcome this problem, we will derive the penetration rate of each ICT variable by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
ict_derived <- ict %>%
  mutate(`RADIO_PR` = `Radio`/`Total households`*1000) %>%
  mutate(`TV_PR` = `Television`/`Total households`*1000) %>%
  mutate(`LLPHONE_PR` = `Land line phone`/`Total households`*1000) %>%
  mutate(`MPHONE_PR` = `Mobile phone`/`Total households`*1000) %>%
  mutate(`COMPUTER_PR` = `Computer`/`Total households`*1000) %>%
  mutate(`INTERNET_PR` = `Internet at home`/`Total households`*1000) %>%
  rename(`DT_PCODE` =`District Pcode`,`DT`=`District Name`,
         `TS_PCODE`=`Township Pcode`, `TS`=`Township Name`,
         `TT_HOUSEHOLDS`=`Total households`,
         `RADIO`=`Radio`, `TV`=`Television`, 
         `LLPHONE`=`Land line phone`, `MPHONE`=`Mobile phone`,
         `COMPUTER`=`Computer`, `INTERNET`=`Internet at home`) 
```

Let us review the summary statistics of the newly derived penetration rates using the code chunk below.

```{r}
summary(ict_derived)
```

Notice that six new fields have been added into the data.frame. They are RADIO_PR, TV_PR, LLPHONE_PR, MPHONE_PR, COMPUTER_PR, and INTERNET_PR.

# 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 5.1 EDA using Statistical Graphics

We can plot the distribution of the variables (i.e. Number of households with radio) by using appropriate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as shown in the code chunk below.

Histogram is useful to identify the overall distribution of the data values (i.e. left skew, right skew or normal distribution)

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
       aes(x=`RADIO`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue")
```

Boxplot is useful to detect if there are outliers.

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
       aes(x=`RADIO`)) +
  geom_boxplot(color="black", 
               fill="light blue")
```

Next, we will also plotting the distribution of the newly derived variables (i.e. Radio penetration rate) by using the code chunk below.

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
       aes(x=`RADIO_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
       aes(x=`RADIO_PR`)) +
  geom_boxplot(color="black", 
               fill="light blue")
```

::: callout-tip
-   Histogram

    -   The RADIO_PR dataset seems to have symmetrical distribution, though it appears to be a right-skewed.

    -   Most of the data is concentrated between 100 to 300.

-   Boxplot

    -   There is one outlier at the upper end.

    -   The interquartile range (IQR) suggests that the central 50% of the data lies roughly between 140 to 270.

    -   The median value is around 210.
:::

The code chunks below are used to create the data visualisation. They consist of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.

```{r}
radio <- ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
             aes(x= `RADIO_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue")

tv <- ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
             aes(x= `TV_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue")

llphone <- ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
             aes(x= `LLPHONE_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue")

mphone <- ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
             aes(x= `MPHONE_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue")

computer <- ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
             aes(x= `COMPUTER_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue")

internet <- ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
             aes(x= `INTERNET_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue")
```

Next, the [*ggarrange()*](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/reference/ggarrange.html) function of [**ggpubr**](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/index.html) package is used to group these histograms together.

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
ggarrange(radio, tv, llphone, mphone, computer, internet, 
          ncol = 3, 
          nrow = 2)
```

## 5.2 EDA using Choropleth Map

### 5.2.1 Joining Geospatial Data with Aspatial Data

Before we can prepare the choropleth map, we need to combine both the geospatial data object (i.e. *shan_sf*) and aspatial data.frame object (i.e. *ict_derived*) into one. This will be performed by using the [*left_join*](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join.tbl_df.html) function of **dplyr** package. The *shan_sf* simple feature data.frame will be used as the base data object and the *ict_derived* data.frame will be used as the join table.

The code chunks below is used to perform the task. The unique identifier used to join both data objects is *TS_PCODE*.

```{r}
#| eval: false
shan_sf <- left_join(shan_sf, 
                     ict_derived, by=c("TS_PCODE"="TS_PCODE"))
  
write_rds(shan_sf, "data/rds/shan_sf.rds")
```

The *TS_CODE* field is the common field used to perform the left-join, as we define the field using by.

```{r}
names(shan_sf)
```

It is important to note that there is no new output data been created. Instead, the data fields from *ict_derived* data frame are now updated into the data frame of *shan_sf*.

```{r}
shan_sf <- read_rds("data/rds/shan_sf.rds")
```

### 5.2.2 Preparing Choropleth Map

To have a quick look at the distribution of Radio penetration rate of Shan State at township level, a choropleth map will be prepared.

The code chunks below are used to prepare the choroplethby using the *qtm()* function of **tmap** package.

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
qtm(shan_sf, "RADIO_PR")
```

In order to reveal the distribution shown in the choropleth map above are bias to the underlying total number of households at the townships, we will create two choropleth maps, one for the total number of households (i.e. TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map) and one for the total number of household with Radio (RADIO.map) by using the code chunk below.

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map <- tm_shape(shan_sf) + 
  tm_fill(col = "TT_HOUSEHOLDS",
          n = 5,
          style = "jenks", 
          title = "Total households") + 
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) 

RADIO.map <- tm_shape(shan_sf) + 
  tm_fill(col = "RADIO",
          n = 5,
          style = "jenks",
          title = "Number Radio ") + 
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) 

tmap_arrange(TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map, RADIO.map,
             asp=NA, ncol=2)
```

Notice that the choropleth maps above clearly show that townships with relatively larger number ot households are also showing relatively higher number of radio ownership.

Now let us plot the choropleth maps showing the dsitribution of total number of households and Radio penetration rate by using the code chunk below.

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
tm_shape(shan_sf) +
    tm_polygons(c("TT_HOUSEHOLDS", "RADIO_PR"),
                style="jenks") +
    tm_facets(sync = TRUE, ncol = 2) +
  tm_legend(legend.position = c("right", "bottom"))+
  tm_layout(outer.margins=0, asp=0)
```

::: callout-tip
-   The two map for households, there is no much different

-   However, for Number of Radio and Radio_PR. The RADIO_PR have some province become more dense compare with the map for Number of Radio.
:::

# 6. Correlation Analysis

Before we perform cluster analysis, it is important for us to ensure that the cluster variables are not highly correlated.

In this section, you will learn how to use [*corrplot.mixed()*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/corrplot.pdf) function of [**corrplot**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html) package to visualise and analyse the correlation of the input variables.

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
cluster_vars.cor = cor(ict_derived[,12:17])
corrplot.mixed(cluster_vars.cor,
         lower = "ellipse", 
               upper = "number",
               tl.pos = "lt",
               diag = "l",
               tl.col = "black")
```

The correlation plot above shows that COMPUTER_PR and INTERNET_PR are highly correlated. This suggest that only one of them should be used in the cluster analysis instead of both.

# 7. Hierarchy Cluster Analysis

In this section, I will learn how to perform hierarchical cluster analysis. The analysis consists of four major steps:

## 7.1 Extracting Clustering Variables

The code chunk below will be used to extract the clustering variables from the *shan_sf* simple feature object into data.frame.

```{r}
cluster_vars <- shan_sf %>%
  st_set_geometry(NULL) %>%
  select("TS.x", "RADIO_PR", "TV_PR", "LLPHONE_PR", "MPHONE_PR", "COMPUTER_PR")
head(cluster_vars,10)
```

Notice that the final clustering variables list does not include variable INTERNET_PR because it is highly correlated with variable COMPUTER_PR.

Next, we need to change the rows by township name instead of row number by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
row.names(cluster_vars) <- cluster_vars$"TS.x"
head(cluster_vars,10)
```

Notice that the row number has been replaced into the township name.

Now, we will delete the TS.x field by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
shan_ict <- select(cluster_vars, c(2:6))
head(shan_ict, 10)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(shan_ict, "data/rds/shan_ict.rds")
```

```{r}
shan_ict <- read_rds("data/rds/shan_ict.rds")
```

## 7.2 Data Standardisation

In general, multiple variables will be used in cluster analysis. It is not unusual their values range are different. In order to avoid the cluster analysis result is baised to clustering variables with large values, it is useful to standardise the input variables before performing cluster analysis.

## 7.3 Min-Max Standardisation

In the code chunk below, *normalize()* of [*heatmaply*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heatmaply/index.html) package is used to stadardisation the clustering variables by using Min-Max method. The *summary()* is then used to display the summary statistics of the standardised clustering variables.

```{r}
shan_ict.std <- normalize(shan_ict)
summary(shan_ict.std)
```

Notice that the values range of the Min-max standardised clustering variables are 0-1 now.

## 7.4 Z-score Standardisation

Z-score standardisation can be performed easily by using [*scale()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/scale) of Base R. The code chunk below will be used to stadardisation the clustering variables by using Z-score method.

```{r}
shan_ict.z <- scale(shan_ict)
describe(shan_ict.z)
```

Notice the mean and standard deviation of the Z-score standardised clustering variables are 0 and 1 respectively.

**Note:** [*describe()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Hmisc/versions/4.4-0/topics/describe) of [**psych**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psych/index.html) package is used here instead of *summary()* of Base R because the earlier provides standard deviation.

***Warning: Z-score standardisation method should only be used if we would assume all variables come from some normal distribution.***

## 7.5 Visualising the Standardised Clustering Variables

Beside reviewing the summary statistics of the standardised clustering variables, it is also a good practice to visualise their distribution graphical.

The code chunk below plot the scaled *Radio_PR* field.

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
r <- ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
             aes(x= `RADIO_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue") +
  ggtitle("Raw values without standardisation")

shan_ict_s_df <- as.data.frame(shan_ict.std)
s <- ggplot(data=shan_ict_s_df, 
       aes(x=`RADIO_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue") +
  ggtitle("Min-Max Standardisation")

shan_ict_z_df <- as.data.frame(shan_ict.z)
z <- ggplot(data=shan_ict_z_df, 
       aes(x=`RADIO_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue") +
  ggtitle("Z-score Standardisation")

ggarrange(r, s, z,
          ncol = 3,
          nrow = 1)
```

::: callout-tip
-   The raw values without standardization, the distribution shows a moderately right-skewed pattern, with a few higher values pushing the tail towards the right.

-   The Min-Max Standardization rescales the data between 0 and 1, preserving the original distribution's shape.

-   The Z-score Standardization transforms the data based on standard deviations from the mean, centering the distribution around 0.
:::

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
r <- ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
             aes(x= `RADIO_PR`)) +
  geom_density(color="black",
               fill="light blue") +
  ggtitle("Raw values without standardisation")

shan_ict_s_df <- as.data.frame(shan_ict.std)
s <- ggplot(data=shan_ict_s_df, 
       aes(x=`RADIO_PR`)) +
  geom_density(color="black",
               fill="light blue") +
  ggtitle("Min-Max Standardisation")

shan_ict_z_df <- as.data.frame(shan_ict.z)
z <- ggplot(data=shan_ict_z_df, 
       aes(x=`RADIO_PR`)) +
  geom_density(color="black",
               fill="light blue") +
  ggtitle("Z-score Standardisation")

ggarrange(r, s, z,
          ncol = 3,
          nrow = 1)
```

## 7.6 Computing Proximity Matrix

In R, many packages provide functions to calculate distance matrix. We will compute the proximity matrix by using [*dist()*](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/dist.html) of R.

*dist()* supports six distance proximity calculations, they are: **euclidean, maximum, manhattan, canberra, binary and minkowski**. The default is *euclidean* proximity matrix.

The code chunk below is used to compute the proximity matrix using *euclidean* method.

```{r}
proxmat <- dist(shan_ict, method = 'euclidean')
```

The code chunk below can then be used to list the content of *proxmat* for visual inspection.

```{r}
proxmat
```

## 7.7 Computing Hierarchical Clustering

In R, there are several packages provide hierarchical clustering function. In this hands-on exercise, [*hclust()*](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/hclust.html)of R stats will be used.

*hclust()* employed agglomeration method to compute the cluster. Eight clustering algorithms are supported, they are: ward.D, ward.D2, single, complete, average(UPGMA), mcquitty(WPGMA), median(WPGMC) and centroid(UPGMC).

The code chunk below performs hierarchical cluster analysis using ward.D method. The hierarchical clustering output is stored in an object of class **hclust** which describes the tree produced by the clustering process.

```{r}
hclust_ward <- hclust(proxmat, method = 'ward.D')
```

We can then plot the tree by using *plot()* of R Graphics as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
plot(hclust_ward, cex = 0.6)
```

## 7.8 Selecting the Optimal Clustering Algorithm

One of the challenge in performing hierarchical clustering is to identify stronger clustering structures. The issue can be solved by using use [*agnes()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/cluster/versions/2.1.0/topics/agnes) function of [**cluster**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cluster/) package. It functions like *hclus()*, however, with the *agnes()* function you can also get the agglomerative coefficient, which measures the amount of clustering structure found (values closer to 1 suggest strong clustering structure).

The code chunk below will be used to compute the agglomerative coefficients of all hierarchical clustering algorithms.

```{r}
m <- c( "average", "single", "complete", "ward")
names(m) <- c( "average", "single", "complete", "ward")

ac <- function(x) {
  agnes(shan_ict, method = x)$ac
}

map_dbl(m, ac)
```

With reference to the output above, we can see that Ward’s method provides the strongest clustering structure among the four methods assessed. Hence, in the subsequent analysis, only Ward’s method will be used.

## 7.9 Determining Optimal Clusters

Another technical challenge face by data analyst in performing clustering analysis is to determine the optimal clusters to retain.

There are [three](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~gwalther/gap) commonly used methods to determine the optimal clusters, they are:

-   [Elbow Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_method_(clustering))

-   [Average Silhouette Method](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0377042787901257?via%3Dihub)

-   [Gap Statistic Method](http://www.web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/gap.pdf)

### 7.9.1 Gap Statistic Method

The [**gap statistic**](http://www.web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/gap.pdf) compares the total within intra-cluster variation for different values of k with their expected values under null reference distribution of the data. The estimate of the optimal clusters will be value that maximize the gap statistic (i.e., that yields the largest gap statistic). This means that the clustering structure is far away from the random uniform distribution of points.

To compute the gap statistic, [*clusGap()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/cluster/versions/2.1.0/topics/clusGap) of [**cluster**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cluster/index.html) package will be used.

```{r}
set.seed(12345)
gap_stat <- clusGap(shan_ict, 
                    FUN = hcut, 
                    nstart = 25, 
                    K.max = 10, 
                    B = 50)
# Print the result
print(gap_stat, method = "firstmax")
```

Also note that the [*hcut*](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/factoextra/reference/hcut.html) function used is from [**factoextra**](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/factoextra/index.html) package.

Next, we can visualise the plot by using [*fviz_gap_stat()*](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/factoextra/reference/fviz_nbclust.html) of [**factoextra**](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/factoextra/index.html) package.

```{r}
fviz_gap_stat(gap_stat)
```

With reference to the gap statistic graph above, the recommended number of cluster to retain is 1. However, it is not logical to retain only one cluster. By examine the gap statistic graph, the 6-cluster gives the largest gap statistic and should be the next best cluster to pick.

**Note:** In addition to these commonly used approaches, the [NbClust](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NbClust/) package, published by Charrad et al., 2014, provides 30 indices for determining the relevant number of clusters and proposes to users the best clustering scheme from the different results obtained by varying all combinations of number of clusters, distance measures, and clustering methods.

## 7.10 Interpreting the Dendrograms

In the dendrogram displayed above, each leaf corresponds to one observation. As we move up the tree, observations that are similar to each other are combined into branches, which are themselves fused at a higher height.

The height of the fusion, provided on the vertical axis, indicates the (dis)similarity between two observations. The higher the height of the fusion, the less similar the observations are. Note that, conclusions about the proximity of two observations can be drawn only based on the height where branches containing those two observations first are fused. We cannot use the proximity of two observations along the horizontal axis as a criteria of their similarity.

It’s also possible to draw the dendrogram with a border around the selected clusters by using [*rect.hclust()*](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/rect.hclust.html)of R stats. The argument *border* is used to specify the border colors for the rectangles.

```{r}
plot(hclust_ward, cex = 0.6)
rect.hclust(hclust_ward, 
            k = 6, 
            border = 2:5)
```

## 7.11 Visually-Driven Hierarchical Clustering Analysis

In this section, we will learn how to perform visually-driven hiearchical clustering analysis by using [*heatmaply*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heatmaply/index.html) package.

With **heatmaply**, we are able to build both highly interactive cluster heatmap or static cluster heatmap.

### 7.11.1 Transforming the Data Frame into a Matrix

The data was loaded into a data frame, but it has to be a data matrix to make your heatmap.

The code chunk below will be used to transform *shan_ict* data frame into a data matrix.

```{r}
shan_ict_mat <- data.matrix(shan_ict)
```

### 7.11.2 Plotting Interactive Cluster Heatmap using heatmaply()

In the code chunk below, the [*heatmaply()*](https://talgalili.github.io/heatmaply/reference/heatmaply.html) of [heatmaply](https://talgalili.github.io/heatmaply/index.html) package is used to build an interactive cluster heatmap.

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
heatmaply(normalize(shan_ict_mat),
          Colv=NA,
          dist_method = "euclidean",
          hclust_method = "ward.D",
          seriate = "OLO",
          colors = Blues,
          k_row = 6,
          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),
          fontsize_row = 4,
          fontsize_col = 5,
          main="Geographic Segmentation of Shan State by ICT indicators",
          xlab = "ICT Indicators",
          ylab = "Townships of Shan State"
          )
```

## 7.12 Mapping the Cluster Formed

With closed examination of the dendragram above, we have decided to retain six clusters.

[*cutree()*](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/cutree.html) of R Base will be used in the code chunk below to derive a 6-cluster model.

```{r}
groups <- as.factor(cutree(hclust_ward, k=6))
```

The output is called *groups*. It is a *list* object.

In order to visualise the clusters, the *groups* object need to be appended onto *shan_sf* simple feature object.

The code chunk below form the join in three steps:

-   the *groups* list object will be converted into a matrix;

-   *cbind()* is used to append *groups* matrix onto shan_sf to produce an output simple feature object called `shan_sf_cluster`; and

-   *rename* of **dplyr** package is used to rename *as.matrix.groups* field as *CLUSTER*.

```{r}
shan_sf_cluster <- cbind(shan_sf, as.matrix(groups)) %>%
  rename(`CLUSTER`=`as.matrix.groups.`)
```

Next, *qtm()* of **tmap** package is used to plot the choropleth map showing the cluster formed.

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
qtm(shan_sf_cluster, "CLUSTER")
```

The choropleth map above reveals the clusters are very fragmented. The is one of the major limitation when non-spatial clustering algorithm such as hierarchical cluster analysis method is used.
