-   Variable Standardisation Techniques

    -   Z-score =\> not good if the data is highly scale, good for normally distributed data.

    -   Min-Max =\> used if the data is highly scale

-   **Correlation Analysis =\>** to find out if there is any linear relationship.

    -   0 =\> no relationship

    -   +- 0.5 =\> moderate correlation

    -   +- 0.8 =\> strong correlation

-   **Hierarchical Method**

    -   **Agglomerative clustering** =\> bottom up approach

        -   No of cluster will become smaller and smaller.

        -   Different from K mean =\> the variable cannot change cluster after form a clustering.

    -   **Divisive clustering** =\> top down approach

    -   Note: It will always give positive index
